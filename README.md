## What it does 

This project is an experimentation with a javascript library called three.js. The project displays 3D interactivty with an object, text and a background. In the webapp, users can click on the object or text and watch it change its position, scale and rotation in 3D space. The background is an infinite loop that makes it seem like the user is travelling through a white space with dark particles. Users can also change the perspective of how they view the objects by clicking and dragging the screen. 

## How it was built 

This project was built using minimal amounts of html/css with a ton of javascript. 

## Setup

To run the program locally after copying the html/css/javascript code, the user must download three.js as well as OrbitControls.js for the project to be fully functional and interactive. 

## How it looks

Screenshots of the app can be found under...

## Credits 
As a beginner, this project was made with a bottom-up learning style. Building this project required a lot of research and tutorials. The tutorials that were used for this project are Red Stapler's 3D Space Warp JavaScript Effect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bed1z7f1EI4 and DesignCourse's Three.js Crash Course for Absolute Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oFvqLfRnsU.
